title: About Us
---

We're a group of film enthusiasts in the Seattle suburbs interested in how labor, gender, caste, and class issues are portrayed in South Asia. We watch films in multiple languages, from multiple communities and perspectives. Most of us are not film critics and don't have an academic background in the humanities. But we hope our never-ending Letterboxd list can make us better audiences, and motivate our worldview and solidarities. Join us at a screening or field trip and let's watch something together!
