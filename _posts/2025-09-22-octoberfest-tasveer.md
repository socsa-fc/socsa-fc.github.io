---
The [2025 Tasveer Film Festival](https://tasveer.org/) schedule was released last week! Which means our first ever Field Trip is officially on the calendar. We picked the two TFF days that had the most to offer for a range of South Asian and diaspora audiences, centered around the Tasveer Film Center in Columbia City. Keep reading for our picks and please [RSVP on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/field-trip-tasveer-film-festival-2025-tickets-1712283218199) if you'd like to join us! 

:money_with_wings: & :ticket: : TFF tickets are 17 USD Regular / 14 USD Student for each session. You are responsible for purchasing your own ticket, either through the screening pages or at the Box Office.

:bus: :train: & : The Tasveer Film Center is a short walk from the Columbia City 1 Line station, and close to the 7/9/50/106 bus stops. We will meet at the front of the building before we head out for each activity. 

:fork_and_knife: & :cocktail: : On Friday we will stop by a Happy Hour at [Marination](https://marinationmobile.com/) or [Island Soul](https://www.islandsoulrestaurant.com/). On Saturday we'll have a relaxed brunch at [Geraldine's Counter](https://www.geraldinescounter.com/) before the program gets underway but unfortunately lunch will likely be short and hurried given the schedule. If you want a break from the screen I recommend stopping by [Spice Waala](https://www.spicewaala.com/) or [Billiard Hoang](https://share.google/qrjDgcWrefjlVwKpi) before the Saturday PM session. The latter has pool tables for more of a social vibe than a tiny storefront. On both days we'll tentatively go to [Taco City Taqueria](https://tacocitysea.com/) since it's one of the few restaurants open past 9, actual plan TBD day-of.


## Option 1: Let's talk about tech baby
We know AI is coming for all of our jobs. As I'm writing this the YouTube ad playing in the other tab is trying to sell (or hire me for?) yet another data annotation service. But I've wanted to see more media about AI's parallel impacts on labor, environment, and even the way we think / solve problems / approach nature. I think Aranya Sahay's *[Humans in the Loop](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33581992/)* is exactly the rumination I've been looking for. And it's quite fitting in a region that's [rapidly building data centers](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/17/nx-s1-5501579/washington-hydropower-data-center-boom-sustainability-climate-change) without adequate attention to the [climate costs](https://www.propublica.org/series/power-hungry). Is it possible to leave no digital trace, or potentially leave a positive one? Maybe we'll find out.

*Friday, October 10*           
**5:00 pm**: Happy hour and apps at [Marination](https://marinationmobile.com/) or [Island Soul](https://www.islandsoulrestaurant.com/) (optional)

**9:00 pm**: dinner and discussion at Taco City Taqueria (optional)           


## Option 2: All Day Movie Mix-and-Match 
I'll be honest, this requires some commitment. Basically we're spending 8 hours at TFF - but you are free to join and leave whenever you'd like! We might leave for a bit too if it gets a bit much. Today's lineup is a little about a lot - [the environment](https://tffm2025.eventive.org/schedule/68ab26c735aaa78d6a88dff6), [fear](https://tffm2025.eventive.org/schedule/68aafe760f680073aa15a02a), [grit and survival](https://tffm2025.eventive.org/schedule/68ab26c735aaa78d6a88e006), [institutional violence](https://tffm2025.eventive.org/schedule/68aafe760f680073aa15a026), [caregiving](https://tffm2025.eventive.org/schedule/68aafe760f680073aa15a022), and [queerness](https://tffm2025.eventive.org/schedule/68ab26c735aaa78d6a88e00a). The Beacon Theater is also ~10 min walk from the Tasveer Film Center and the Seattle Latino Film Festival (SLFF) is happening there - see [our post about SLFF](https://socsa-fc.github.io/2025-09-22-octoberfest-continues-with-slff/) for ideas.

*Saturday, October 11: Optional AM*               
**11:00 am**: brunch at Geraldine's Counter           
*Pick one*: **12:00 pm** [Echoes of Earth: The Mother, The Sons, and the Holy River](https://tffm2025.eventive.org/schedule/68ab26c735aaa78d6a88dff6)  OR **12:00 pm** [Pinch / Skin / Blister](https://tffm2025.eventive.org/schedule/68aafe760f680073aa15a02a)                      
*Pick one*: **2:30 pm**: [Resilience and Reinvention](https://tffm2025.eventive.org/schedule/68ab26c735aaa78d6a88e006) OR **2:40 pm**: [Life at Crossroads](https://tffm2025.eventive.org/schedule/68aafe760f680073aa15a026)                    


The afternoon session truly makes me wish I had a time turner. The two LGBTQIA screening blocks are the obvious highlight here - but don't sleep on the [Aging, Care, and Defiance](https://tffm2025.eventive.org/schedule/68aafe760f680073aa15a022) session. 
Director Shayar Gandhi's advertising background combined with the bright colors of a Gujarati kitchen makes for luscious cinema in *[Paswaar](https://filmfreeway.com/Paswaar)*. I'll admit I already cried watching the trailer - and it hits harder once you remember how touch-starved we all were post-Covid.

In the afternoon [Queer Horizons](https://tffm2025.eventive.org/schedule/68ab26c735aaa78d6a88e00e) / [Hidden Desires](https://tffm2025.eventive.org/schedule/68ab26c735aaa78d6a88e00a) double session, I'm looking forward to Iniyavan Elumalai's *[Pakka](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32651287/)* about four gay men figuring out friendship and life on the cricket pitch, as well as Shruti Parekh's *[Zari](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32311363/)*. I was surprised that the longer feature [We Are Faheem & Karun](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt34284832/) is being billed as Kashmir's first queer love story. [Trans Kashmir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_7gk0qTYho) was released in 2022, so I'd say we're overdue for some queer stories beyond geopolitical, cis-, and hetero-normative boundaries. Here's an interesting [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mY6fnpp5mc) with writer/director/producer Onir (of *[My Brother... Nikhil](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0419992/)* fame) - maybe watch this *after* the movie so the themes make sense.

*Pick one*: **4:15 pm** [Aging, Care, and Defiance](https://tffm2025.eventive.org/schedule/68aafe760f680073aa15a022)  OR **4:20 pm** [Hidden Desires](https://tffm2025.eventive.org/schedule/68ab26c735aaa78d6a88e00a)

**9:00** pm: dinner and discussion at Taco City Taqueria (optional)           


## Option 3: Shorts and Sweets
If you're more into shorts than features, go to TFF/SLFF on Sunday for back-to-back shorts programs. Maybe start your day with a Viet coffee from [Coffeholic House](https://coffeeholichouse.com/) and a pastry from [Columbia City Bakery](https://www.columbiacitybakery.com/) to get in the right headspace. I think these shorts will add a pinch of levity to close out festival weekend. For example, I already know Vidhya Iyer's *Giving Mom the Talk* will make me cringe HARD, and probably for the better?

Did you end up going to TFF 2025 and/or find this useful? [Let us know](mailto:socsafceastside@gmail.com)! And if you can, please advocate for a more balanced October across the Seattle film festival planning communities! I’m not quite sure why this one October weekend has SO MUCH going on but I’ll be spending a couple of weeks away from any big screens after this - phew! Happy October(Movie)Fest all!
