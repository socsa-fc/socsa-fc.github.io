title: October(Movie)Fest Part 1 - Tasveer 2025
subtitle: 
tags: [film festivals, Tasveer, seattle, 2025]
---
The [2025 Tasveer Film Festival](https://tasveer.org/) schedule was released last week! Which means our first ever Field Trip is officially on the calendar. We picked the two TFF days that had the most to offer for a range of South Asian and diaspora audiences, centered around the Tasveer Film Center in Columbia City. Keep reading for our picks and please [RSVP on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/field-trip-tasveer-film-festival-2025-tickets-1712283218199) if you'd like to join us! 

:money_with_wings: & :ticket: : TFF tickets are 17 USD Regular / 14 USD Student for each session. You are responsible for purchasing your own ticket, either through the screening pages or at the Box Office.

:bus: & :train: : The Tasveer Film Center is a short walk from the Columbia City 1 Line station, and close to the 7/9/50/106 bus stops. We will meet at the front of the building before we head out for each activity. 

:fork_and_knife: & :cocktail: : Columbia City has several [excellent restaurants](https://seattle.eater.com/maps/best-restaurant-columbia-city) but since we're only in the area for two days, we'll keep our food adventures short. You cannot go wrong with [Coffeholic House](https://coffeeholichouse.com/), [Columbia City Bakery](https://www.columbiacitybakery.com/), or [Taproot Cafe](https://www.taprootseattle.com/) for a quick bite. As part of our planned festival agenda, we will stop by Happy Hour at [Marination](https://marinationmobile.com/) or [Island Soul](https://www.islandsoulrestaurant.com/) on Friday. On Saturday we'll have a relaxed brunch at [Geraldine's Counter](https://www.geraldinescounter.com/) before the program gets underway but unfortunately lunch will likely be short and hurried given the schedule. If you want a break from the screen I recommend stopping by [Spice Waala](https://www.spicewaala.com/) or [Billiard Hoang](https://share.google/qrjDgcWrefjlVwKpi) before the Saturday PM session. The latter has pool tables for more of a social vibe than a tiny storefront. On both days we'll tentatively go to [Taco City Taqueria](https://tacocitysea.com/) since it's one of the few restaurants open past 9, actual plan TBD day-of.

:calendar: : We're proposing three blocks that best represent TFF 2025's lineup:

* [Feature Friday](#option1)
* [Saturday Cinemarathon](#option2)
* [Short and Sweet Sunday](#option3)


## Feature Friday <a id='option1'></a>         
Let's talk about tech baby! We know AI is coming for all of our jobs. As I'm writing this the YouTube ad playing in the other tab is trying to sell (or hire me for?) yet another data annotation service. But I've wanted to see more media about AI's parallel impacts on labor, environment, and even the way we think / solve problems / approach nature. I think Aranya Sahay's *[Humans in the Loop](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33581992/)* is exactly the rumination I've been looking for. And it's quite fitting in a region that's [rapidly building data centers](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/17/nx-s1-5501579/washington-hydropower-data-center-boom-sustainability-climate-change) without adequate attention to the [climate costs](https://www.propublica.org/series/power-hungry). Is it possible to leave no digital trace, or potentially leave a positive one? Maybe we'll find out.

*Friday, October 10*           
**5:00 pm**: Happy hour and apps at [Marination](https://marinationmobile.com/) or [Island Soul](https://www.islandsoulrestaurant.com/) (optional)              
**6:30 pm**: [Artificial Intimacies: A Door To My Memory](https://tffm2025.eventive.org/schedule/68aafe760f680073aa15a01a) (2 hrs)           
**9:00 pm**: dinner and discussion at Taco City Taqueria (optional)           


## Saturday Cinemarathon <a id='option2'></a>        
I'll be honest, this requires some commitment. Basically we're spending 8 hours at TFF - but you are free to join and leave whenever you'd like! We might leave for a bit too if it gets a bit much. Today's lineup is a little about a lot - [the environment](https://tffm2025.eventive.org/schedule/68ab26c735aaa78d6a88dff6), [fear](https://tffm2025.eventive.org/schedule/68aafe760f680073aa15a02a), [grit and survival](https://tffm2025.eventive.org/schedule/68ab26c735aaa78d6a88e006), [institutional violence](https://tffm2025.eventive.org/schedule/68aafe760f680073aa15a026), [caregiving](https://tffm2025.eventive.org/schedule/68aafe760f680073aa15a022), and [queerness](https://tffm2025.eventive.org/schedule/68ab26c735aaa78d6a88e00a). The Beacon Theater is also ~10 min walk from the Tasveer Film Center and the Seattle Latino Film Festival (SLFF) is happening there - see [our post about SLFF](https://socsa-fc.github.io/2025-09-22-octoberfest-continues-with-slff/) for ideas. 

I know it's a long day but show up and show out for the morning shorts sessions anywy. Short films don't get enough love in desi circles compared to longer features, but that's where tomorrow's big names cut their teeth. I'm excited to see see Uttera Singh's *Pinch* ([based on a real story](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/woman-reports-neighbour-for-harassment-during-navratri-in-ahmedabad/articleshow/114196321.cms)!), Vinay Umapathy's *Behind the Line*, and Pranav Dawar's *Maut Ka Kuan* (Well of Death). You might remember the last from a certain [Hanumankind video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOHKltAiKXQ). *The Patel Motel Story* looks super interesting too - I only learned about Patels being known for motel chains from a [Nimesh Patel set](https://youtube.com/shorts/Iv-nAH5R83M?si=gBVams2-wWTWHB3o). An [interview with the film directors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYRXkQdcVK4) was also helpful in tracing the history. The directors highlight a 1999 NYT article titled *[A Patel Motel Cartel?](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/04/magazine/a-patel-motel-cartel.html)* which describes this pattern as a "nonlinear ethnic niche: a certain ethnic group becomes entrenched in a clearly identifiable economic sector, working at jobs for which it has no evident cultural, geographical or even racial affinity". The article goes on to discuss caste, chain migration, the Gujarati diaspora from East Africa, and the economics of an aging GI generation selling assets to poor immigrants with surprising clarity. Do read if you can.

*Saturday, October 11: Optional AM*               
**11:00 am**: brunch at Geraldine's Counter           
*Pick one*: **12:00 pm** [Echoes of Earth: The Mother, The Sons, and the Holy River](https://tffm2025.eventive.org/schedule/68ab26c735aaa78d6a88dff6)  OR **12:00 pm** [Pinch / Skin / Blister](https://tffm2025.eventive.org/schedule/68aafe760f680073aa15a02a)                      
*Pick one*: **2:30 pm**: [Resilience and Reinvention](https://tffm2025.eventive.org/schedule/68ab26c735aaa78d6a88e006) OR **2:40 pm**: [Life at Crossroads](https://tffm2025.eventive.org/schedule/68aafe760f680073aa15a026)                    


The afternoon session truly makes me wish I had a time turner. The two LGBTQIA screening blocks are the obvious highlight here - but don't sleep on the [Aging, Care, and Defiance](https://tffm2025.eventive.org/schedule/68aafe760f680073aa15a022) session. Director Shayar Gandhi's advertising background combined with the bright colors of a Gujarati kitchen makes for luscious cinema in *[Paswaar](https://filmfreeway.com/Paswaar)*. I'll admit I already cried watching the trailer - and it hits harder once you remember how touch-starved we all were post-Covid.

In the afternoon [Queer Horizons](https://tffm2025.eventive.org/schedule/68ab26c735aaa78d6a88e00e) / [Hidden Desires](https://tffm2025.eventive.org/schedule/68ab26c735aaa78d6a88e00a) double session, I'm looking forward to Iniyavan Elumalai's *[Pakka](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32651287/)* about four gay men figuring out friendship and life on the cricket pitch, as well as Shruti Parekh's *[Zari](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32311363/)*. I was surprised that the longer feature [We Are Faheem & Karun](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt34284832/) is being billed as Kashmir's first queer love story. [Trans Kashmir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_7gk0qTYho) was released in 2022, so I'd say we're overdue for some queer stories beyond geopolitical, cis-, and hetero-normative boundaries. Here's an interesting [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mY6fnpp5mc) with writer/director/producer Onir (of *[My Brother... Nikhil](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0419992/)* fame) - maybe watch this *after* the movie so the themes make sense.

## Short and Sweet Sunday <a id='option3'></a>
If you're more into shorts than features anyway, return to TFF/SLFF on Sunday for back-to-back shorts programs. I think these shorts will add a pinch of levity to close out festival weekend. For example, I already know Vidhya Iyer's *Giving Mom the Talk* will make me cringe HARD, and probably for the better?
