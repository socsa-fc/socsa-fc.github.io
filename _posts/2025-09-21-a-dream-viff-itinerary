title: A dream itinerary for VIFF 2025
subtitle: We can't go but maybe you can?

---

Vancouver BC is only a 3 hour drive from Seattle - so it's no surprise that we love [VIFF](https://viff.org/festival/) as much as [SIFF](https://www.siff.net/festival). Unfortunately, VIFF falls on the same weekend at [Tasveer](https://tasveer.org/), and during a busy October. With the addition of ongoing border chaos, we're choosing to stay close to home this year. But maybe you live closer to Van City than us, or can drive up during the week? Here are some desi-oriented schedule ideas for VIFF 2025! 
Heads up, individual film tickets are [21 CAD Regular / 16 CAD Student + taxes](https://viff.org/ticket-info/#festival). You can also buy a six-pack of tickets for [120 CAD Regular / 95 CAD Student + taxes](https://viff.org/ticket-info/#festival).

### Option 1: A long lunch or a date night feature
If you can only see one show during VIFF this year, run - don't walk! - to see [I am Revathi](https://viff.org/whats-on/viff25-i-am-revathi/). Of all the South Asian features on VIFF's schedule I'm most excited about this one, but I think the screening times don't quite allow you to see much before/after. No matter - this is worth your whole evening. Director P. Abhijith extends a tender lens towards trans lives in [Antharam (2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antharam), and I'm excited to see [A. Revathi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._Revathi)'s critical LGBTQ activism centered in their latest feature!

{: .box-success} [I am Revathi](https://viff.org/whats-on/viff25-i-am-revathi/) is screening on **Tuesday, 7 October at 8:30 pm** and on **Wednesday, 8 October at 12 pm**.

Another evening feature option is [*Bhoothaalam*, or Hidden Tremors](https://viff.org/whats-on/viff25-hidden-tremors/), VIFF 2025's only Malayalam entry. Kerala's climate crisis is the backdrop for this story about climate refugees and their grief. I imagine architect and director Sreekanth Pangapattu can demonstrate better than most how we slowly become inured to ecological devastation. He is quoted in [The New Indian Express](https://www.newindianexpress.com/kerala/2025/Sep/11/tremors-of-a-forewarning-2) as saying, “We are destroying natural resources. Nothing is predictable anymore. Nature can change in an instant, and the reason is us. If the film makes people think about being more careful and more nature-friendly, I will feel I have succeeded”.  

{: .box-success} [Hidden Tremors - 1.25 hrs](https://viff.org/whats-on/viff25-hidden-tremors/) is screening on **Friday, 10 October at 8:45 pm** and on **Saturday, 10 October at 11:15 am** 


### Option 2: Playing hooky on a weekday

This option involves taking a day off work and spending it at the movies - we think that's time well spent. There are of course 10 days of great choices here, but the schedule for **Thursday, 9 October** looks quite promising specifically for South Asian and diaspora stories. The following agenda keeps you close to the International Village area for a jam-packed day you'll be thinking about for months afterward. 

{: .box-success}
**11:00 am** [CycleMahesh - 1 hr](https://viff.org/whats-on/viff25-cyclemahesh/)
Pick one: 
  **12:15 pm** [Seeds - 2 hrs](https://viff.org/whats-on/viff25-seeds/)
  **1:15 pm** [Your Touch Makes Others Invisible - 1 hr](https://viff.org/whats-on/viff25-your-touch-makes-others-invisible/)
Pick one:
  **3:45 pm** [Human Resource - 2 hrs](https://viff.org/whats-on/viff25-human-resource/) 
  **3:30 pm** [Clan of the Painted Lady - 1.75 hrs](https://viff.org/whats-on/viff25-clan-of-the-painted-lady/) - at VIFF Centre, 30 min walk/20 in bus ride from International Village
**6:00 pm** [My Father's Son - 1.75 hrs](https://viff.org/whats-on/viff25-my-fathers-son/) 
**9:30 pm** [Ma: Cry of Silence - 1.25 hrs](https://viff.org/whats-on/viff25-ma-cry-of-silence/)
***TOTAL COST*** ~105 CAD

*Food, etc*: Stop by [TAKO](https://www.takovancouver.com), [Taishoken Ramen](https://www.taishoken-ramen.com), or [Tashkent](https://www.tashkent-restaurant.com) for lunch. Alternatively, grab a quick bite from the Chinatown T&T across the street before rushing to the next movie! And if you get overwhelmed by the content, consider hanging out with some cats at the nearby [Catfe](https://catfe.ca) to remind yourself there is good in the world.


### Option 3: Weekend Viewing Warrior 

If you'd rather attend VIFF over the Canadian Thanksgiving long weekend, here's a pared-down selection that walks the fine line between active engagement and film festival exhaustion. The [Hidden Tremors](https://viff.org/whats-on/viff25-hidden-tremors/) screening on Friday night (Oct 10) could be a proper feature if you wish - but in the interest of a safe drive home, we're suggesting the Saturday AM screening instead. As always, pick and choose your schedule as you wish!
