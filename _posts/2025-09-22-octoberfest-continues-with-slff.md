title: October(Movie)Fest Part 2: SLFF 2025
subtitle: Once more unto the week!
tags: [film festivals, SLFF, TFF]
---

If you looked at the [Seattle Latino Film Festival](https://slff.org/) program and guessed you HAD to buy a festival pass to see anything, you are hereby forgiven. I made the same mistake based on the opening night announcement on the [SLFF](https://slff.org/) homepage. But now that the festival offerings are fully available on [Brown Paper Tickets](https://www.brownpapertickets.com/profile/4708316), it looks like many events coincide with [Tasveer](https://tasveer.org/) and [VIFF](https://viff.org). If you still have some energy left - or just want a break from routine programming - here are some ideas for making the most of SLFF 2025!
*Note*: SLFF events are priced at 10-18 USD Regular / 8-15 USD Senior/Student per screening. TFF events are priced at 17 USD Regular / 15 USD Senior/Student per screening.

## Option 1: The Downpour, plus a cross-endorsement

Call it a [Mamdani moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYH_zerPE3M). We're already planning to spend most of Saturday, 11 October at the [Tasveer Film Festival](https://tasveer.org)- and [you're invited, of course](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/field-trip-tasveer-film-festival-2025-tickets-1712283218199?aff=oddtdtcreator). BUT, if you'd like a change of pace/language/cultures, SLFF's primary venue at [The Beacon](https://thebeacon.film/) is a convenient 10 min walk up Rainier Ave! Theaters and film fora in the Sound have been [in a state](https://www.realchangenews.org/news/2025/03/07/recent-seattle-cinema-closures-force-owners-go-back-drawing-board) since Covid, and the joint uphill climb of inflation / layoffs / high rents / dwindling arts funding isn't helping anyone. The least we can do as an audience is [help The Beacon thrive](https://web.archive.org/web/20250324200031/https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/movies/seattle-movie-theaters-arent-dying-theyre-changing/) while supporting Latinx filmmakers who've made the stressful trek to our side of the woods. I'd suggest picking a Spanish-language feature based on what you're curious about on the day - [an autistic childhood in a loving family](https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/6714462)), [homesickness in Seattle](https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/6714735) (sounds familiar), [enduring lesbian love](https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/6714746), or [perseverence and resilience](https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/6714744). I don't know much about any of these directors but clearly there's no wrong choice here.

*Saturday, October 11 2025*
**1:00 pm**: [Codigo Marcos / The Apricot](https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/6714462) (1.5 hrs)
**2:45 pm**: [Home (Sick)](https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/6714735) (1.25 hrs)

If you're up for more movie hopping, stick around on Sunday for back-to-back TFF/SLFF shorts programs. Maybe start your day with a Viet coffee from [Coffeholic House](https://coffeeholichouse.com/) and a pastry from [Columbia City Bakery](https://www.columbiacitybakery.com/) to set the tone. I think these shorts will add a pinch of levity to close out what I'm calling October(Movie)Fest. For example, I already know Vidhya Iyer's *Giving Mom the Talk* will make me cringe HARD, and probably for the better?

SLFF's tone is a bit more serious compared to TFF - and unfortunately there's just more TFF happening that weekend. I was curious about [Una Isla / Cuba's Eternal Night](https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/6715760) Sunday evening, but then learned that director Jordan Allott has a [niche in faith-based filmmaking](https://indefenseofchristians.org/people/jordan-allot-2/) and rose to success with his 2010 [documentary](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1656705/) on Cuban pro-life doctor [Oscar Biscet](https://www.npr.org/2007/11/05/15994973/cuban-dissident-awarded-medal-of-freedom). Not exactly my cup of tea but you can end your day with that if you'd like.

## Option 2: The Drizzle
tbh I have no idea if we'll be in drizzle szn by this time. But if you live close enough to The Beacon you can catch an interesting mid-week lineup that us Eastsiders might hesitate to make the trek out West for. You probably also know this area better, but I wanted to shout out some local highlights from [Plate of Nations](https://www.plateofnations.com/restaurants/) around here too. Get dinner from [Alem](https://alemrestaurant.com/), [Maa Kiin](https://share.google/dtL1BAB2WZteN5Hwt), or [Taco City Taqueria](https://www.tacocitysea.com/) and then head to the movies - sounds like a cozy start to the Big Dark if you ask me.

Did you end up going to SLFF 2025 and/or find this useful? [Let us know](mailto:socsafceastside@gmail.com)! And if you can, please advocate for a more balanced October across the Seattle film festival planning communities! I'm not quite sure why this one October weekend has SO MUCH going on but I'll be spending a couple of weeks away from any big screens after this - phew! Happy October(Movie)Fest all!
