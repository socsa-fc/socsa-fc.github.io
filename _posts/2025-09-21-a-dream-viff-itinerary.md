title: A dream itinerary for VIFF 2025
subtitle: We can't make it but maybe you can?
tags: [film festivals, VIFF]
---

Vancouver BC is only a 3 hour drive from Seattle - so it's no surprise that we love [VIFF](https://viff.org/festival/) as much as [SIFF](https://www.siff.net/festival). Unfortunately, VIFF falls on the same weekend at [Tasveer](https://tasveer.org/) this year and during a busy October. With the addition of ongoing border chaos, we're choosing to stay close to home this year. But maybe you live closer to Van City than us, or can drive up during the week? If so, we're suggesting three VIFF 2025 itineraries based on your interest/availability: 

* [A long lunch or a date night feature](#option1)
* [Playing hooky on a weekday](#option2)
* [Weekend Viewing Warrior](#option3) 

:money_with_wings: & :ticket: : Heads up, individual film tickets are [21 CAD Regular / 16 CAD Student + taxes](https://viff.org/ticket-info/#festival). You can also buy a six-pack of tickets for [120 CAD Regular / 95 CAD Student + taxes](https://viff.org/ticket-info/#festival).

:fork_and_knife: : Stop by [TAKO](https://www.takovancouver.com), [Taishoken Ramen](https://www.taishoken-ramen.com), or [Tashkent](https://www.tashkent-restaurant.com) for lunch. Alternatively, grab a quick bite from the Chinatown T&T across the street before rushing to the next movie! And if you get overwhelmed by the content, consider hanging out with some cats at the nearby [Catfe](https://catfe.ca) to remind yourself there is good in the world.


### Option 1: A long lunch or a date night feature<a id='option1'></a>
If you can only see one show during VIFF this year, run - don't walk! - to see [I am Revathi](https://viff.org/whats-on/viff25-i-am-revathi/). Of all the South Asian features on VIFF's schedule I'm most excited about this one, but I think the screening times don't quite allow you to see much before/after. No matter - this is worth your whole evening. Director P. Abhijith extends a tender lens towards trans lives in [Antharam (2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antharam), and I'm excited to see [A. Revathi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._Revathi)'s critical LGBTQ activism centered in their latest feature!

{: .box-success} 
[I am Revathi](https://viff.org/whats-on/viff25-i-am-revathi/) (2 hrs) is screening on **Tuesday, 7 October at 8:30 pm** and on **Wednesday, 8 October at 12 pm**.

Another evening feature option is [*Bhoothaalam*, or Hidden Tremors](https://viff.org/whats-on/viff25-hidden-tremors/), VIFF 2025's only Malayalam entry. Kerala's climate crisis is the backdrop for this story about climate refugees and their grief. I imagine architect and director Sreekanth Pangapattu would be attuned to the cracks forming in our homes and psyches as we slowly become inured to ecological devastation. He is quoted in [The New Indian Express](https://www.newindianexpress.com/kerala/2025/Sep/11/tremors-of-a-forewarning-2) as saying, “We are destroying natural resources. Nothing is predictable anymore. Nature can change in an instant, and the reason is us. If the film makes people think about being more careful and more nature-friendly, I will feel I have succeeded”.  

{: .box-success} 
[Hidden Tremors](https://viff.org/whats-on/viff25-hidden-tremors/) (1.25 hrs) is screening on **Friday, 10 October at 8:45 pm** and on **Saturday, 10 October at 11:15 am** 


### Option 2: Playing hooky on a weekday<a id='option2'></a>

This option involves taking a day off work and spending it at the movies - we think that's time well spent. There are of course 10 days of great choices here, but the schedule for **Thursday, 9 October** looks quite promising specifically for South Asian and diaspora stories. The following agenda keeps you close to the International Village area for a jam-packed day you'll be thinking about for months afterward. 

The chaos of India's Covid lockdown and its impacts on migrant workers is [well-documented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_migrant_workers_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic). For a non-sensationalist recap, I found the video reporting by [Kisan India](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a63EM8Mjg_Q) and [Gaon Connection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXouRQeZy0I) quite informative. [CycleMahesh](https://www.cyclemahesh.in/) is bound to be a good reminder of precarious migrant livelihoods, and the institutional and interpersonal kindness migrant workers deserve. And bear in mind, protagonist Mahesh is probably better off than his peers given he owned/could buy a cycle!

After this, I suggest seeing Brittany Shyne's *Seeds*, which [Variety calls](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/seeds-review-1236293534/) "a film as patient and persevering as the Black farmers it documents". There's a lot ot be said about the gap between black and white farmers' livelihoods in the US, and I'll leave that in Shyne's capable hands. Your other option is Rajee Samarasinghe's [Your Touch Makes Others Invisible](https://viff.org/whats-on/viff25-your-touch-makes-others-invisible/). Sri Lankan movies about the Tamil genocide rightfully deserve scrutiny - Deepa Mehta's *Funny Boy* [came under criticism in 2020](https://www.tamilguardian.com/content/soft-power-still-power-mehta-funny-boy-and-tamil-genocide) for not casting Tamil actors and collaborating with the Sri Lankan government for movie production. And it's not lost on me that the [International South Asian Film Festival](https://isaff.ca/film-festival/) - unfolding the week before VIFF - is opening with a Fireside Chat with the very same Deepa Mehta! In a country with the [LARGEST Tamil diaspora from the genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamil_diaspora)! Unfortunately it looks like Mehta's power aligns nicely with iSAFF organizers' ambitions to center Surrey in the South Asian/diaspora film circuit. At least it looks like Samarasinghe has learned from this - the film features a Tamil lead actress, and the explicit consent of Tamil mothers whose children were disappeared during the genocide. Is this sufficient grounds to tell this story? We'll leave you to decide. 

The afternoon selection is more Asian than South Asian. Shots of ordinary lives in Jennifer Chiu's *Clan of the Painted Lady* about the [Hakka people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakka_people) look meditatively composed and deeply personal. Did you know that Hakkas are the largest Chinese community in India after the Cantonese?

The Maw Naing's *Ma: Cry of Silence* is a high-stakes story about a sweatshop workers' strike under Myanmar's current dictatorship. The premise reminded me of Rubaiyyat Hossain's 2019 film [Made in Bangladesh](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8147262/) - with a significantly darker political bent of course. Something tells me there might be additional consequences to their strike beyond just losing jobs. For an overivew of Myanmar's recent political history [here's a primer](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHUmiH2vn1K1Lo_7qFIc7-eXc77POnbPX) made by Myanmar law students after the 2021 coup and protests. I hope *Ma: Cry of Silence* will be help remind us about the importance of political resistance against seemingly insurmountable odds.

### Option 3: Weekend Viewing Warrior<a id='option3'></a>

If you'd rather attend VIFF over the Canadian Thanksgiving long weekend, here's a pared-down selection that walks the fine line between active engagement and film festival exhaustion. After kicking off the morning with some festival heavy hitters, we suggest you pick a story from either [Chiapas, Mexico](https://viff.org/whats-on/viff25-i-died/) or [Nairobi, Kenya](https://viff.org/whats-on/viff25-how-to-build-a-library/). *Li Cham* reminds me of Laura Huertas Millán's [La Libertad](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7289450/) where the filmmaker presents a distinctly etic (outsider) perspective on gendered labor and its material products - arrestingly vibrant textiles. Director Ana Ts'uyeb, on the other hand, puts forth a necessary [emic (insider) perspective](https://moreliafilmfest.com/en/struggle-autonomy-and-freedom-interview-ana-tsuyeb-director-li-cham) to contextualize the patriarchal violence and liberatory aspirations of Tsolil women. In Kenya, directors Maia Lekow and Christopher King present [Book Bunk](https://www.bookbunk.org/)'s work restoring Nairobi's libraries. I think the framing leans into the NGO savior complex (Book Bunk co-founder Angela Wachuka is as an [Obama Foundation Leader](https://www.obama.org/programs/leaders/africa/2019/angela-wachuka/)), but given the current era of [censorship in American libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_censorship_in_the_United_States) a reminder of the long path to preserving knowledge seems timely. And also, did you know the [Dewey Demical System is racist](https://journals.cilip.org.uk/catalogue-and-index/article/view/643)? 

In the evening, Varsha Bharath's *Bad Girl* might be the most masala-adjacent movie on VIFF's roster. I think it might be [Easy A](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1282140/)-adjacent with a predictable middle-class Tam-brahm feminism to it. I find that a bit diluted but both Kollywood and Bollywood desperately need more women telling womens' stories, so I say go support Bharath anyway. This movie is also a collab between [Anurag Kashyap](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0440604/) and [Vetrimaaran](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4274575/) of all people. I'm undecided on whether North-South Indian collaborations like this should be encouraged, but I realize this is how new projects happen. As much as we'd like to fast-forward past the awkward starts, we're stuck with the likes of [Atrangi Re](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9766332/) and [Dhadak 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhadak_2) until better Hindi cinema comes along.

If *Bad Girls* isn't your cuppa, the VIFF shorts section might be. Director Tathagata Ghosh's films (*[Miss Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SKc47-3l94), ([Jodi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdd4eC6-6XY), [Dhulo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOCYMVh4Od0)*) are equal parts queer, Bengali, and political - and *My Comrade* looks like a perfect 'all of the above'. Animator and director [Cordell Barker](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0054855/)'s thoughts on AI would probably also be insightful. I'm probably too dense to understand the visual language of the rest of the lineup or [Lemohang Jeremiah Mosese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NZVkzGBlS0)'s oeuvre but the vibe looks abstract/spooky.
